# Death Clock üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Localghost

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Tino Sabu - SSET
- Member 2: Pranav Jayan - SSET

### Project Description
A quirky web app that calculates how many years, days, and seconds you have left to live ‚Äî based on your age and lifestyle answers. It turns life expectancy into a personalized countdown clock for some deep (or dark) reflection.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People never know exactly how much time they have left ‚Äî but who really wants to think about that? Let‚Äôs add a little dramatic countdown just for fun!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By asking silly and serious questions about your habits, this app gives you a life clock ticking down your remaining time ‚Äî because everyone needs a little existential motivation disguised as a game!
